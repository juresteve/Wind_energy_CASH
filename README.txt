This project aims to predict the energy generated in a particular wind farm in Galicia, Spain in the year 2019 given some meteorological conditions. The specific instructions for the project are in a PDF named firstassignment in the folder Data & Report.
The project is split into 3 different folders named Data & Report, Training models & Scripts and Final models & Predictions. The main body of the project is the notebook in Data & Report named Assignment_1, where the rest of the documents are also explained. This notebook is also presented in html format for better readability. In this folder we have also included the instructions for the project, the data provided and a text file with the imputed data.

The other two folders contain several python scripts referenced in the main notebook, which were used to train the necessary machine learning models. These models are also included in these folders. In particular, the Final models & Predictions folder contains the selected models and their generating scripts which were used to predict the competition data, as well as a text file with these predictions called Final predictions.
